If you are on PC, just download the WindowsBuild.zip file, extract it and run the GameJam.exe application, you do NOT need
to have the Unity game engine installed on your computer.

If you are on MAC, download the MacBuild.zip file and do whatever you need to do to run it on a Mac because I have no idea.

Enjoy!
