Thank you for playing our game ZombieLand!

Game Overview:
You control a anti-aircraft gun defending against an alien invasion trying to buy time for
the last survivors of Earth to escape on their spaceships. You will lose the game if you run
completely out of ammunition or if all three of the buildings are destoyed by the alien ships.
In the top left corner of the screen you will see your total remaining ammo for your surface to air
missiles as well as your cannon. You will also see how many rounds are currently loaded as well as
be able to see if you are currently reloading.

Weapons:
Cannon: The cannon fires very fast but each individual round does not do much damage,
however with such a high rate of fire it is easy to just spray rounds into the sky and take
out the enemy ships with ease.
Surface to air missiles: These are unguided rockets, they don't move very quickly
but if one hits an enemy ship it will destroy it in one hit! The reload speed for these is double
the time of the reload time for the cannon.

Controls:
Shoot the cannon: Left mouse click
Shoot surface to air missiles: Right mouse click
