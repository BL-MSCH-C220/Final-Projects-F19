Story:

WIP Planet Name: Kalbek

The idea is that the apocalypse had happened decades before. Everything is in ruins and few surviving communities remain. The “Apocalypse” will most likely be caused by über capitalism. The overpopulation caused by the high reproductive rates of the Kal (the working name for the planetary race) and the corporate compensation for such by overusing resources. Thus the planet began to run dry. Factories closed and a world reliant on jobs and consumerism ground to a halt. Riots broke out coupled with looting. People mostly blamed corporations and groups began raiding the buildings that were still operational and doing whatever with the employees. The end of the world is dark so ya know….bad shit happens. Anyways, the character you play is born decades later and escaped from a community run by one of the original raider groups that now operate out of an old corporate building. Before you escaped, you contacted a rumored group that wants to establish a new government devoid of raiders. You have to make it through some treacherous ruins to get to their ship while exploring and figuring out what happened in the place you’re exploring. I came up with this in literally 5 minutes so it may change when I write the notes. I just needed a foundational story for crafting the environment.

Sign: condemned 

Notes:
*in blood* “Fear the Masters”

Hilde,
I am leaving tonight. They came and said they found something in Krys’s hut. There were loud noises and I think I heard gunshots. Once things are quiet I’m making a break for it. If you see this, meet me in our emergency shelter in the mountains. There should be enough rations to last us until the raids calm down.

I love you more than anything.

Be safe,
Aleks

End Scene Crawl:

It has been 10 years since the fall. Since the Masters gained control after the riots, the Kalbek freedom fighters have been operating from the shadows, offering a promise of freedom to refugees. For too long the Masters have been ruling over those that they saw as weak, placing them in camps and segregating into ghetto communities with little food, water, and warm clothing. Soon, that will end. 

Hope will rise again.
