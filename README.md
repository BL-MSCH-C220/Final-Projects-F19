# Final-Projects—Fall-2019

The fall 2020 game jam was held from 2–4 December 2019. The theme for the jam was "End of the World". The class members organized into groups (2–4 members) and created a game from scratch in 49 hours consistent with that theme.

The groups presented their projects in class, and the projects are kept here for future reference. The grading criteria were as follows:
 * [1 point] Repository contains an appropriate software license
 * [1] Repository contains a descriptive README.md
 * [4] Game runs to completion without syntax or other runtime errors
 * [5] The project is a game (with a challenge, a measure of success, and opportunities for mastery)
 * [4] It is clear that every member of the team has contributed
 * [3] The game is an appropriate response to the theme
 * [2] Extra features, polish, juiciness
